Hybrid Intelligence/Multiagent Intrusion Detection Data Mining System

Built (building) using the Python based SPADE2 multi-agent framework (thanks Javier Palanca)
right now these are just python scripts until I figure out how to put them into real agents (help?)

Some prerequisites:
Make sure the following software is installed and in the path
python
python-pip
SPADE2
csvtool
tcptrace
weka
tshark

Also make sure the following scripts are in the path (like a scripts directory)
pdml2arff.py

Naming Conventions
preprocessing.algorithmtype.step#.description.agent/script.extension
datamining.algorithmtype.step#.description.agent/script.extension
